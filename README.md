# ase23
This repo holds all of my homework code as well as my project code
The below headers describe the folders found in docs and src
Output files for the current tests are held in etc/out/

## Final Project
The final project is stored in `src/project` with its own readme. The paper is called `Tystahl_791_Automated_Software_Final.pdf` and is located both in the main directory and in the project folder. Documentation is sparse and there are loose comments. Apologies in advance!

## hw1
This folder holds the files for the first homework aimed at getting us used to working in a TDD (Test Driven Development) environment as well as learning lua.

The onScript.md holds information on how to run the tests

## hw2
This folder holds the files for the second homework aimed at creating our data representation with columns and rows so that we can do experiments on that data in the future

The onData.md holds information on how to run the tests as well as other .html files in the docs for each files seperately

## hw3
This folder holds the files for the third homework aimed at creating our clustering algorithm and optimization of such clustering with sway. 

The onCluster.md holds information on how to run the tests as well as other .html files in the docs for each files seperately

## hw4
This folder holds the files for the fourth homework aimed at creating our regrid analysis tool. 

The onGrid.md holds information on how to run the tests as well as other .html files in the docs for each files seperately stored in ./docs/hw4

The **WRITEUP** is stored in ./docs/hw4/Task5Writeup.md. The regrids for task 5 were also added to the testing yaml so the results can be found in task5Out.txt in the ./etc/out/ folder.

I have also added them to the main folder of the repo for easier grading

## hw5
This folder holds the files for the Fifth homework aimed at creating our clustering algorithm and optimization of such clustering with sway. 

The onBins.md holds information on how to run the tests as well as other .html files in the docs for each files seperately

I have also added for this homework, a bash script to run bins.py called **hw5Runner.sh** to make it easier to grade

## hw6
This folder holds the files for the Sixth homework aimed at creating our explaining clustering algorithm based on rules. 

The onXpln.md holds information on how to run the tests as well as other .html files in the docs for each files seperately

I have also added for this homework, a bash script to run bins.py called **hw6Runner.sh** to make it easier to grade

## hw7
This folder holds the files for the Seventh homework aimed at creating statistics functions to explain our data for our final project. 

The onStats.md holds information on how to run the tests as well as other .html files in the docs for each files seperately

I have also added for this homework, a bash script to run bins.py called **hw7Runner.sh** to make it easier to grade
