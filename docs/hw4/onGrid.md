### How to run (From top of repo)

'cd src/hw4/; python3 grid.py -g all'

### How to run the regrids (From top of repo)

'cd src/hw4/; python3 grid.py -g Every

* Please note that it is similar to the command 'every' but it has to be capitalized to do the regrids. The repgrids for task 5 are not included in the 'all' command so to check them you have to run this seperately. The outfiles are stored in the out folder as specified in the main README.md
