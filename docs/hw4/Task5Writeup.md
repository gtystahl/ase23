### Topic -> Bars in Raleigh
I decided to do a clustering on the local bars here in Raleigh (Or close by)

### Survey 1
This was my starting person. As per the instructions, I only had this person come up with a small number of examples (The discord said 3 but I did 4 to allow the next person some opportunity of choice). Thus, the clustering for this one seems very small, however it still seems to make sense. It split the bars two and two with having two brewery esc bars together and two liquor and wine bars together. It also grouped Music and Atmosphere together and Cost and Drink options together. 

### Survey 2
This was my second person and offered a lot more information with their clustering. I had this person pick 3 bars from the first person and add 6 more bars along with 6 new attributes. Then, I had them rate their 9 bars based on their 6 attributes. The results seemed to match the clustering of the first person keeping breweries and liquor bars separate, however this person added some more social bars which created some more separation on the liquor and wine bars. The qualities that resemble each other from this person's perspective is the quality, size, and price of the bars. Along with those includes the group of music volume, variety of beer, and the number of people.

### Survey 3
This was my third person which created 6 more examples and attributes along with using three examples from the second person. Their clustering was similar to the other two, but instead of wine and liquor bars, there were more sports bars. The spread this time moved some other bars around (Such as ones with more beer according to person 2) to be considered more of a brewery and the others to fall closer to a sports bar esc. The attribute groups this time were volume of music, cost, and design of the place as well as the other group of crowd size, distance to NC State, and drink variety.

### Conclusions
There were a lot of similarities between the results of the interviewed people. I believe this is due to the fact that there was one attribute that was consistent across all of the people which was price. This price difference seemed to separate the more elegant, quiet bars which meant wine and liquor bars from the louder, beer focused bars and sports bars. What was also interesting is that there was one bar that for one person it was considered with the breweries, but for another it was considered closer to the finer establishments. With personal experience of visiting this place (The Raleigh Beer Garden), I can say that it can be considered either one. It has its refined elements, but also its louder live music side. Another thing that I found interesting was how clusterable this data ended up being. I was expecting some of these bars to be more outliers than they were.
