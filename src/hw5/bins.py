#  that divided numerics into (say) 16 bins, then recursively merges adjacent bins in the splits are less informative than the combination.
#  At its start, this code uses recursive Fastmap to find a few `best` examples, then a sample of the `rest`. `bins.lua`
#  then prunes bins that have similar distributions in `best` and `rest
