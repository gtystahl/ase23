# This code supports multi-goal semi-supervised explanation.  Here,  optimization 
# is treated as a kind of data mining; i.e.  we recursively bi-cluster (using the 
# distance to two remote points), all the while pruning the  "worst" half of the 
# data (as measured by a multi-goal domination predicate).
# During this, we  only label one or two points per cluster. Afterwards, 
# the rules we generate to explain the better rows is generated from the delta between best cluster and the rest.</p>
