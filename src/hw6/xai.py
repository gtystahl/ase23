# This code supports multi-goal semi-supervised explanation.  Here,  optimization 
# is treated as a kind of data mining; i.e.  we recursively bi-cluster (using the 
# distance to two remote points), all the while pruning the  "worst" half of the 
# data (as measured by a multi-goal domination predicate).
# During this, we  only label one or two points per cluster. Afterwards, 
# the rules we generate to explain the better rows is generated from the delta between best cluster and the rest.</p>
# For help with code, see comments at the <a href="#about">end of this file</a>.</p>

# ## <a name=about>About this code</a>
# <p style="text-align: left;">
# The aim here was to achieve as much functionality in as few lines as possible
# (to simplify teaching these ideas as well as any further experimentation).
# All the code for the above functionality comes in at just
# under 300 lines of AI code (plus another 200 lines of  misc support routines). 
# <p style="text-align: left;">
# To read this, code:<br>
# FIRST skim the `help` string (at top);  <br>   
# SECOND browse the structs (see "<a href="#create">Creation</a>");  <br> 
# THIRD read  the <a href="#egs">examples</a> at end.  </p>
# <p style="text-align: left;">
# Note that any of the examples can be run from the command line; 
# e.g. "-g show" runs
# all the actions that start with "show". 
# Also, all the settings in the help string can
# be changed on the command line; e.g. "lua fetchr.lua -s 3" sets the seed to 3.
# Those settings are stored in"the" table, which is generated from
# "help". </p>
# <p style="text-align: left;">
# In the function arguments, the following conventions apply (usually):</p>
#     
# -  Two spaces denote start of optional args
# -  Four spaces denote start of local args. 
# -  n == number
# -  s == string
# -  t == table
# -  is == boolean
# -  x == anything
# -  fun == function
# -  UPPER = class (some factory for making similar things)
# -  lower = instance; e.g. sym is an instance of SYM
# -  xs == a table of "x"; e.g. "ns" is a list of numbers
#     
# <p style="text-align: left;">
# In this language (LUA) vars are global by default unless marked with "local" or 
# defined in function argument lists.
# Also,  there is only one data structure called a "table".
# that can have numeric or symbolic keys.
